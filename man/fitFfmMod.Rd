\value{
\code{fitFfm} returns an object of class \code{"ffm"} for which 
\code{print}, \code{plot}, \code{predict} and \code{summary} methods exist. 

The generic accessor functions \code{coef}, \code{fitted} and 
\code{residuals} extract various useful features of the fit object. 
Additionally, \code{fmCov} computes the covariance matrix for asset returns 
based on the fitted factor model.

An object of class \code{"ffm"} is a list containing the following 
components:
\item{factor.fit}{list of fitted objects that estimate factor returns in each 
time period. Each fitted object is of class \code{lm} if 
\code{fit.method="LS" or "WLS"}, or, class \code{lmRob} if 
\code{fit.method="Rob" or "W-Rob"}.}
\item{beta}{N x K matrix of factor exposures for the last time period.}
\item{factor.returns}{xts object of K-factor returns (including intercept).}
\item{residuals}{xts object of residuals for N-assets.}
\item{r2}{length-T vector of R-squared values.}
\item{factor.cov}{K x K covariance matrix of the factor returns.}
\item{g.cov}{ covariance matrix of the g coefficients for a Sector plus market and Sector plus Country plus global market models .}
\item{resid.cov}{N x N covariance matrix of residuals.}
\item{return.cov}{N x N return covariance estimated by the factor model, 
using the factor exposures from the last time period.}
\item{restriction.mat}{The restriction matrix used in the computation of f=Rg.}
\item{resid.var}{length-N vector of residual variances.}
\item{call}{the matched function call.}
\item{data}{data frame object as input.}
\item{date.var}{date.var as input}
\item{ret.var}{ret.var as input}
\item{asset.var}{asset.var as input.}
\item{exposure.vars}{exposure.vars as input.}
\item{weight.var}{weight.var as input.}
\item{fit.method}{fit.method as input.}
\item{asset.names}{length-N vector of asset names.}
\item{factor.names}{length-K vector of factor.names.}
\item{time.periods}{length-T vector of dates.}
Where N is the number of assets, K is the number of factors (including the 
intercept or dummy variables) and T is the number of unique time periods.

\description{
Fit a fundamental (cross-sectional) factor model using ordinary
least squares or robust regression. Fundamental factor models use observable
asset specific characteristics (or) fundamentals, like industry
classification, market capitalization, style classification (value, growth)
etc. to calculate the common risk factors. An object of class \code{"ffm"}
is returned.
}
\details{
Estimation method "LS" corresponds to ordinary least squares using 
\code{\link[stats]{lm}} and "Rob" is robust regression using 
\code{\link[robust]{lmRob}}. "WLS" is weighted least squares using estimates 
of the residual variances from LS regression as weights (feasible GLS). 
Similarly, "W-Rob" is weighted robust regression.

Standardizing style factor exposures: The exposures can be standardized into
z-scores using regular or robust (see \code{rob.stats}) measures of location 
and scale. Further, \code{weight.var}, a variable such as market-cap, can be 
used to compute the weighted mean exposure, and an equal-weighted standard 
deviation of the exposures about the weighted mean. This may help avoid an 
ill-conditioned covariance matrix. Default option equally weights exposures 
of different assets each period. 

If \code{rob.stats=TRUE}, \code{\link[robust]{covRob}} is used to compute a 
robust estimate of the factor covariance/correlation matrix, and, 
\code{\link[robustbase]{scaleTau2}} is used to compute robust tau-estimates 
of univariate scale for residuals during "WLS" or "W-Rob" regressions. When 
standardizing style exposures, the \code{\link[stats]{median}} and 
\code{\link[stats]{mad}} are used for location and scale respectively.


The original function was designed by Doug Martin and initially implemented
in S-PLUS by a number of University of Washington Ph.D. students:
Christopher Green, Eric Aldrich, and Yindeng Jiang. Guy Yollin ported the
function to R and Yi-An Chen modified that code. Sangeetha Srinivasan
re-factored, tested, corrected and expanded the functionalities and S3 
methods.
