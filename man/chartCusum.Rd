\usage{
chartCusum(object, digits = 3, which = NULL, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{An object of class \code{cusumActMgr} returned by \code{cusumActMgr}.}

\item{digits}{The number of digits of numerical values in graphs}

\item{which}{A number or a vector of numbers to indicate the type of plots.
If a subset of the plots is required, specify a subset of the numbers 1 and 2
for plots. The numbers 1 and 2 represent: \cr \cr
1 = Barplot of log-excess returns with annually moving average returns,
plot of tracking error, Plot of excess volatility, and Plot of cusum for returns
with protractors of slopes representing the annualized returns,\cr
2 = Barplot of the information ratio, plot of cusumIR with protractors
of slopes with corresponding IR, and a plot of Lindley's Recursion with
the thresholds, and a scatter plot between the fund and benchmark returns
with robust regression\cr}

\item{...}{other graphics parameters in plot}
}
\value{
